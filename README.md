###Constructor Homework
Note: I successfully created a constructor function in scripts/constructor_practice.js but couldn't get the DOM-js  interactivity to work. The constructor uses the function person with name age and fact arguments to assign properties and values to the instance of a person per the blueprint. I instantiated a person "Hamburgler" who is 40 years old and has a food of hamburgers.  The object also has a method that returns a string sentence about the person incorporating their property values.
